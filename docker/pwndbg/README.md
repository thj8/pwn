`pwndbg` (/paʊnˈdiˌbʌɡ/) is a GDB and LLDB plug-in that makes debugging suck less, 
with a focus on features needed by low-level software developers, hardware hackers, 
reverse-engineers and exploit developers.

It has a boatload of features, see [FEATURES.md](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/blob/dev/FEATURES.md) and [CHEATSHEET][CHEATSHEET] 
(feel free to print it!).

[CHEATSHEET]: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16t9MV8KTFXK7oX_CzXhmDdaVnjT8IYM4/view?usp=drive_link

## Why?

Vanilla GDB and LLDB are terrible to use for reverse engineering and exploit development. 
Typing `x/g30x $esp` or navigating cumbersome LLDB commands is not fun and often provides 
minimal information. The year is 2025, and core debuggers still lack many user-friendly 
features such as a robust hexdump command. Windbg users are completely lost when they 
occasionally need to bump into GDB or LLDB.

## What?

Pwndbg is a Python module which is loaded directly into GDB or LLDB*. It provides a suite 
of utilities and enhancements that fill the gaps left by these debuggers, smoothing out 
rough edges and making them more user-friendly.

Many other projects from the past (e.g., [gdbinit][gdbinit], [PEDA][PEDA]) and present 
(e.g. [GEF][GEF]) exist to fill some these gaps. Each provides an excellent experience 
and great features -- but they're difficult to extend (some are unmaintained, and all 
are a single [100KB][gdbinit2], [200KB][peda.py], or [363KB][gef.py] file (respectively)).

Pwndbg exists not only to replace all of its predecessors, but also to have a clean 
implementation that runs quickly and is resilient against all the weird corner cases 
that come up.  It also comes batteries-included, so all of its features are available 
if you run `setup.sh`.

## When to Use GDB or LLDB?

Pwndbg supports both GDB and LLDB, and each debugger has its own strengths. 
Here's a quick guide to help you decide which one to use:

| Use Case                                        | Supported Debugger   |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Debugging Linux binaries or ELF files           | **GDB**, **LLDB**    |
| Debugging Mach-O binaries on macOS              | **LLDB**             |
| Linux kernel debugging (qemu-system)            | **GDB**, **LLDB**    |
| Linux user-space emulation (qemu-user)          | **GDB**              |
| Embedded debugging (ARM Cortex M* or RISC-V/32) | **GDB**, **LLDB**    |

Pwndbg ensures a consistent experience across both, so switching between them is seamless.
> The LLDB implementation in Pwndbg is still in early-stage and may contain bugs or limitations.<br/>
> Known issues are tracked in [GitHub Issues][lldb_tracker]. 
> 
> If you encounter any problems, feel free to report them or discuss on our [Discord server][discord].

## How?

For a portable version with no external dependencies, scroll down for the [Portable Installation](#portable-installation) section.

### Installing LLDB

* Install via the Nix package manager (you can use Nix on any distribution):
```shell
nix shell github:pwndbg/pwndbg#pwndbg-lldb
pwndbg-lldb ./your-binary
```
* Or download portable version with no external dependencies, scroll down for the [Portable Installation](#portable-installation) section
* ~~Or install from source, instructions below.~~ (not supported)

### Installing GDB

* Install via the Nix package manager (you can use Nix on any distribution):
```shell
nix shell github:pwndbg/pwndbg
pwndbg ./your-binary
```
* Or download portable version with no external dependencies, scroll down for the [Portable Installation](#portable-installation) section

* Or install from source, instructions below.

Installation from source is straightforward:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg
cd pwndbg
./setup.sh
```

Pwndbg is supported on Ubuntu 22.04, and 24.04 with GDB 12.1 and later. We do not test 
on any older versions of Ubuntu, so `pwndbg` may not work on these versions.
- For Ubuntu 20.04 use the [2024.08.29 release](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/tag/2024.08.29)
- For Ubuntu 18.04 use the [2023.07.17: ubuntu18.04-final release](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/tag/2023.07.17)

We may accept pull requests fixing issues in older versions on a case by case basis, 
please discuss this with us on [Discord][discord] first. You can also always checkout 
an older version of `pwndbg` from around the time the Ubuntu version you're interested
in was still supported by Canonical, or you can attempt to build a newer version of GDB from source.

Other Linux distributions are also supported via `setup.sh`, including:

* Debian-based OSes (via apt-get)
* Fedora and Red Hat (via dnf)
* Clear (via swiped)
* OpenSUSE LEAP (via zypper)
* Arch and Manjaro (via community AUR packages)
* Void (via xbps)
* Gentoo (via emerge)

If you use any Linux distribution other than Ubuntu, we recommend using the [latest available GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/download/) built from source. You can build it as:
```
cd <gdb-sources-dir>
mkdir build && cd build
sudo apt install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libreadline-dev texinfo  # required by build
../configure --disable-nls --disable-werror --with-system-readline --with-python=`which python3` --with-system-gdbinit=/etc/gdb/gdbinit --enable-targets=all
make -j7
```
</details>
