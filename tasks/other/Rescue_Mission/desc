My Valentine, Alex, has been kidnapped and is being held hostage! Help me save Alex by defeating the boss in this game.

Notes:

Every round, enter a number between 1 and the ATK (attack) of the entity whose turn it is (your's or the enemy's).
Your opponent will also select a number from this range and if these numbers match, the attack is 
blocked (unless the attacker is the boss, whose attacks are not blockable). 
If they do not match, the attacking entity scores a hit and some damage is dealt based on the attacker's ATK.

At the beginning of a match, the entity with the smaller PRI (priority) attacks first.

You will face 3 enemies before the final boss. Make sure to keep upgrading your stats in the Shop! You earn money by winning battles.
The game is over once you have faced all 4 enemies, regardless of how well you do.

The Valentine will be displayed once you defeat the boss.
